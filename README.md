This tutorial will walk you through the creation of a custom XBlock. It will allow to display a video in a course, using oEmbed, and record when the student finishes watching it.

Installing XBlock

First, grab the source code for XBlock at https://github.com/edx/XBlock :

    $ git clone https://github.com/edx/XBlock.git
    $ cd XBlock
    $ gvim README.rst

Follow the instructions in `README.md` to get the workbench server up and running. Once you're done, you should be able to visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/
